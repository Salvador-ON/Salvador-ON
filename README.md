<p>Hi I'm a Full-Stack Remote Software Developer with a passion for coding :computer: and creating responsive web applications with intuitive UX/UI :art:. I have experience working front-end interfaces and back-end databases with remote teams, and advanced proficiencies in HTML, CSS, SASS, JavaScript, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, and React/Redux</p>

<p>Additionally, I have over 5 years of experience in the tech field where I managed daily operations of a start-up company, became COO, and through proper management of resources and services, improved production efficiency by 15% :chart_with_upwards_trend:. I developed the inventory and manufacturing execution system, which registered and tracked processes and outcomes of the manufacturing process :factory:.
</p>

<p>I enjoy being challenged and engaging with projects that require me to work outside my comfort zone and knowledge set. Currently, I'm exploring opportunities with companies who want to create and improve their web applications. I'd love to discuss any opportunities you may know.</p>

<h1> Salvador Olvera </h1>
<h3> Full-Stack Web Developer &amp; Mechatronic Engineer </h3>

<p>Full-Stack Remote Software Developer with a passion for coding and creating responsive web applications with intuitive UX/UI. Extensive experience with both front-end interfaces and back-end databases. </p>

<p> I have experience working with remote teams, and advanced proficiencies in HTML, CSS, SASS, JavaScript, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, and React/Redux</p>

<p>Additionally, I have over 5 years of experience in the tech field where I managed daily operations of a start-up company, became COO, and through proper management of resources and services, improved production efficiency by 15%. I developed the inventory and manufacturing execution system, which registered and tracked processes and outcomes of the manufacturing process.
</p>

<p>These experiences have allowed me to develop a great deal of self-discipline, attention to detail, strong communication, project management, organizational skills, and the ability to solve problems and overcome any circumstances. I enjoy being challenged and engaging with projects that require me to work outside my comfort zone and knowledge set. </p>

<p> Currently, I'm exploring opportunities with companies who want to create and improve their web applications. I'd love to discuss any opportunities you may know.</p>
